To cope with the unruly nature of practice, our project managers also have a great talent for improvisation, a proactive attitude and a good dose of stress resistance.",

Defining the scope of the project and drawing up clear preconditions are important facets of a well-realizable project, as are the identification and management of the associated risks.",
